The idea is to show some sample code that contrasts the way MR jobs can be written using various levels MR abstraction layers.
As part of this exercise, we'd cover writing code using

- Vanilla Hadoop MR libraries
- Scalding
- Spark(which is not on top of Hadoop MR, but, internally takes a very similar approach)
